This directory contains C code I wrote for the Navier-Stokes problem described
in Chapter 3 of my thesis.  I scanned Bob Moser's original notes and placed
them in the file moser_notes.tar.gz.  When you issue the command
tar xvf moser_notes.tar  a directory called moser_notes is created and in
there you will find his notes, in PDF format.  

The time_step directory corresponds to the numerical solution of the system of
ordinary differential equations.  The relevant sections in the thesis are
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and Appendices A and B.  See also pages 1-11 of
Bob Moser's notes.

The algebraic_equations directory contains code related to the system of 
nonlinear algebraic equations.  The relevant sections in the thesis are
sections 3.3.1-3.3.3 and Appendices C and D.  See also pages 11-13 of
Bob Moser's notes.

Each directory has a README file with more details.
